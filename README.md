# Heart Attack Complication Mortality Classification

## Context
During this project, I built machine and deep learning models to classify Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack) complication mortality. A publicly available dataset containing data on patients who were admitted to the hospital after a heart attack was used as input data. The project involved an exploratory data analysis, imputing missing values, dealing with class imbalance, hyperparameter optimization, and explainable artificial intelligence. Furthermore, novel tabular deep learning models were employed and evaluated on their performance compared to the current state-of-the-art XGBoost algorithm for tabular data.
